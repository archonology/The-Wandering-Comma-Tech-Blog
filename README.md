## Description
A developer's work is never done -- especially not when it comes to learning new things. I wanted a place where I could make posts about what I am learning, thoughts on coding, etc. The blog needed to exercise and hone my skills in creating a full stack application.  This application  allows for users to sign up, login in, and create and edit posts and comments. This application encrypts passwords and stores them hashed securely in the database.  I plan to add more features to this application over time, like the ability to add photos. Watch for more to come!

## Technology
For this application, Sequelize, MySQL2, Express (and Express Session), Handlebars, Bcrypt, Bootstrap, and Dotenv were used. The app is written in Javascript, HTML5, and CSS.  
    
## Installation
*Installing from the browser: I've only tested this in Google Chrome and Safari.  At this time, the install feature is not compatible with Safari, but does work with Chrome.  

## Usage Info
